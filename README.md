# Learnify-socialapp
 Skill-Sharing &amp; Learning Platform - This project makes use of web technologies to create a Spring Boot  REST API with additional support from a React-based client web application.
 The objective of this project is to create an interactive, community-based website whereby users can publish 
and acquire skills via interactive content and peer-to-peer learning. Learnify enables users to post personal 
profiles, upload tutorials, join study groups, and meet others with similar interests and purpose. The platform 
supports many learning resources like video classes, sessions, forums, and progress monitoring to facilitate group 
learning and independent learning. Members exchange experiences, comment on and like posts, and contribute 
to a body of growing knowledge. With a strong Spring Boot REST API and a dynamic, interactive React-based 
frontend, Learnify provides a seamless, easy-to-use experience that encourages individuals to teach, learn, and 
develop together in a supportive, interactive digital learning environment.
